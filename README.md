# BiomoleculeInteractionPrediction

### ðŸ§¬ Prediction of molecule interaction (lncRNA, miRNA, protein, disease, drug) through GNN.

## Current Progress ðŸš€
- Just started with pre-processing of data.
- **It will be updated frequently** âœ¨

## Overview ðŸŒŸ
This project aims to predict biomolecular interactions using **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**. It focuses on interactions between:
- lncRNA
- miRNA
- Proteins
- Diseases
- Drugs

## Dataset sources 
- STRING
